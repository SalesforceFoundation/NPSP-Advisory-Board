Nonprofit Starter Pack Advisory Board Proposal
----------------------------------------------

### 1. Background

The Nonprofit Starter Pack open source project has continued to provide an alternative platform for nonprofit organizations on the Salesforce platform to build upon over the past 5 years. Given the large numbers of users, organizations and ecosystem partners with a stake in the future of the project, the Salesforce Foundation leadership wants to provide a long-term commitment to a more open governance and contribution model by facilitating and supporting an advisory board.

#### 1.1 What do we want to accomplish?

##### 1.1.1 All voices at the table

The NPSP Advisory Board has seats reserved for the various constituencies who are making long-term investments in the Nonprofit Starter Pack, this includes:

* Individuals who are investing time and effort to contribute to the project
* Organizations using the NPSP
* Partners that are extending, utilizing or enhancing the NPSP in their products and services
* Outside expertise from other open source projects

##### 1.1.2  Transparent Communication & Engagement

The proposal and all documentation behind the NPSP Advisory Board, the selection criteria and process, and the output of meetings will be public and available for comment.

##### 1.1.3  Encouraging Contribution

There is no fee to join the board. Membership on the NPSP Advisory Board is open to partners and individuals who contribute to the overall success and health of the NPSP project. The top contributors (and maintainers) are automatically given a seat on the board. Organizations can only get on the board if they are both current top contributors and agree to implement successful NPSP-based solutions for the community at large.

##### 1.1.4 Augment a Trusted Ecosystem

As more partners and organizations are utilizing the NPSP, it is important that everybody trusts the application will behave in a predictable manner. Guidelines, standard API’s, and roadmap visibility are key tenants to insure transparency and help others plan their product roadmaps and release schedules. We want the NPSP Advisory Board and the community as a whole to help define the specifics of these criteria. General items that we think are important to discuss include: use of standard APIs, repositories, quality guidelines, upstream contribution models, and alternative distributions.

##### 1.1.5  Facilitate Community

The NPSP project was started in 2007 at the Salesforce Foundation, and since that time has been primarily driven by Salesforce Foundation assets and efforts.  The Foundation believes by letting the direction be driven by the community, we will future-proof the project and eliminate the perception that the project direction is dictated solely by the Salesforce Foundation. We would like the NPSP Advisory Board to provide input on this to ensure there is a clear model for contribution, a meritocracy-based path for consideration in input and roadmap direction, and a well-defined model for making decisions within the core contributor team and for maintaining a high level of quality on the project.

##### 1.1.6  Improve the Product

*	In-depth test results, such as usability tests, performance tests, etc.
*	Supporting important but potentially non-obvious aspects of the product development process, including accessibility and extensibility
*	Roadmap discussions. The Salesforce Foundation wants partners, customers and contributors engaged in roadmap discussions and values information on how and when Advisory Board need certain technologies/features as well as input on what is most relevant on the roadmap.


### 2. Purpose

#### 2.1

The primary purpose of the NPSP Advisory Board is to advise the Salesforce Foundation and Nonprofit Starter Pack project core committers on matters related to supporting the long-term governance, structure, and roadmap of the Nonprofit Starter Pack. The following main areas are included in this charter:

* Provide guidance and input to the Salesforce Foundation, and where possible, present a consistent and consolidated opinion from the broader NPSP community.

#### 2.2

### 7. Open Governance Principles

The NPSP Advisory Board will formulate recommendations in conjunction with the following open governance principles:
*	Open Contributions: anyone should be able to participate and contribute. All bugs and tasks will be tracked in a public tracker and all of the source code and all of the tools needed to build it will be available under an open license permitting unrestricted use.
*	Open technical meritocracy: technical merit over pride of authorship. Code is contributed for the express purpose of advancing technologies relevant to the project, effectively separating technology advancement from individual or commercial intent.
*	Open design: Roadmaps are discussed in the open, and designs receive input from all committers and contributors.
*	Influence through contribution: organizations and individuals gain influence over the project through contribution.
*	Open Licensing: code is licensed under the BSD license.

### 8. Core Criteria
Core Criteria will generally cover such areas as: use of standard APIs, testing harness, quality assurance, upstream contribution models, and alternative distributions.
As Core Criteria will not be fully defined when the initial NPSP Advisory Board membership is formulated, it is understood that there is a possibility that certain members of the initial NPSP Advisory Board may not agree with the Core Criteria when they are fully defined or may have products/offerings that are not in compliance with the Core Criteria at the time they are finalized. In this case, the corporate members will either agree to become compliant within a specified timeframe or else resign their NPSP Advisory Board position.
